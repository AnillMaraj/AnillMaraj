## [Anill Louis Maraj](https://anillmaraj.github.io) | Web Designer & Developer
### [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/AnillMaraj)

Hi my name is Anill Maraj, I'm interested in Web Development and Machine Learning. I come from a small Caribbean island
where tropical breeze and relaxing beaches are just outside my doorstep. I enjoy learning new technologies related to media and data science.

### Developer Interests
I particularly enjoy simple coding and media projects, however my key points of interest are;
- Full-stack Web Development
- IoT Devices
- Machine Learning and Data Science
- UI/UX and Media Technology

### Learning Interests
Technologies change so frequently with the constant emergence of new disruptive tools and frameworks that I have accepted my goal isn't to learn all things,
just enough of everything to make life simpler for everyone. That said, I <3 Python and aim to grow my understanding of what it can truly do in the future.
